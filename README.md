My First Github Repo!!!!
Hello World!  My name is Temple and i've been spending the last year or so teaching myself to program.  I started out by getting my feet wet with C# and Unity but now I'm focused on web development.  I think I'm starting to get a handle on javascript and, right now, I'm in love with React!
